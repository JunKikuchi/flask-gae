- Fork the project.
- Make your feature addition or bug fix.
- Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
- Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but
   bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
- Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
